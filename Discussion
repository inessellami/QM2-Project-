What are the key factors that influence number of abortions in a geograpical area
Subjects:
Abortions and boroughs
-education
-income 
-poverty 
-political beliefs 
-religion/ethnicity
-NB of sex health clinics
-Family background

See how the different factors interrelate with each other and affect abortions 
Same area and same time period 

--> to do: 
-litereature about abortion access = get the variables, find the geographical area (by tuesday 27) 
-Meeting on tuesday 
-Start to find data starting from tuesday 

-Web design: Sidney and Ines 

-Aims and objectives?? 
-Limits - we really would like to know the key factors that influence number of unwanted pregnancies where number of abortions are a consequence of this so for the real world/policy based con
we want to link it back

*29/10/2020: meeting*

-northern ireland: catholic influence in ireland, abortion tourism
-religious beliefs, moral conservatism --> causal effects on women's citizenship
-Limits: Maybe difficult to quantify, more qualitative research because of the religious side


-USA: lot of data 
-Hot topic: Amy Coney Barrett
-Social factors that affect abortion: political and religious affiliation, education
-Available data 

-Find a collision effect? 
-Theorize why abortion is illegal --> link religion and conservatism and women citizenship 
-Opinion stats/Raw abortion stats 
-Finding why? 

--> Geographic area: US states
--> Factors: religious affiliation, legality in the state, political affiliation
-Add: income and education level 
-Legality in the state: even if it is legal; states and governors make sure that there are restrictions --> make abortion harder: what makes abortion difficult even if it is legal
-How does legality affect opinion? 
-Difficult to quantify abortion restrictions 
-Treating the factors independently then finding correlation between them

MONDAY:
-Political affiliation: Henry
-Religious affiliation: ines
-Income and education: Nelson
-Legality: Sidney

=> - Political affiliation: Sidney 
-Religious affiliation: ines
-Income: Neslon 
- education: Henry


looking @ 2014 bc only data we have for religiosity is 2014 so this way can do direct comparison

4/12:

 -Data cleaning: we have to use pyhton, so everyone has to clean his own data and send the final dataset to nelson so that he can merge it
 -Demographics: we will have to take into account gender and age in the analysis
 -We will have to make an individual analysis for each state, but the question is how we are going to make the analysis? (we can't make a regression because x is missing). But it is important to do individual state analysis because it is the only way to make sure that we include demographics and legislation properly
-We will also maybe have to add legislation as a quantifiable variable (need to do some research)


-----------------------------
7/12 
-We will not be doing state by state comparison because of data availability 
-We will add legislation as quantifiable variable 
-make sure to do data cleaning on python 
-Challenge: how ot make the heat map interactive ??????
