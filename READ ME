In the code part we have three branches : 
  1. Code: where you will find all the code we created on google colab 
  2. raw data: these are the raw csv files that we used on google colab 
  3. fina data: these are the cleaned data csv file that we got after python cleaning on google colab 
  
In the Wiki section, you will find different sidebars. This is mostly text and notes from our different meetings.
