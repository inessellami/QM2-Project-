What are the key factors that influence the number of abortions per capita in each US state?
  Factors that we'd like to investigate: 
    - religion 
    - political beliefs
    - education levels 
    - age 
    - income 
    

Hypothesis: such factors correlate with number of abortions.  hypothesis can't be implied in research question for reasons of implicit bias 

  (What are the key factors that impede access to abortions in the US? (only via suggestion):touch on this in conclusion- but definitely not the main focus)  
  
  With the current controversy surrounding abortion rights in the United States (US), we have decided to look at variations in the number of abortions from a 
  socio-economic demographic perspective. To this end we seek to draw an inter-state comparison by analysing different factors that may influence access 
  to abortion. We have outlined these factors based on the study conducted by the Pew Foundation in 2019, entitled "Public Opinion on Abortion". The study
  analysed public opinion regarding abortion from 1995-2015 and plotted abortion against religious affiliation, political party and ideology, age as well as 
  education levels. Considering the fact that healthcare is a relatively expensive service in the US, we find it to pertinent to add one more potentially 
  influential factor that we would like to additonally investigate: income.
