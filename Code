Education summary of cleaning data:

Data used to represent education is the percentage of population by state that did not complete highschool between 2014 and 2018.
Data is found using this link: https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 
Columns of data other than the values for total population in 2014-18 were deleted. 
The percentages were then changed to numerical values and the dataset was added to other data in form of the 2014 abortion.csv.
Spread of data was illustrated with a Histogram and Boxplot (see next slide), there were no significantly outlying points.


Party summary of cleaning data:

Raw data presented in the partydata.csv is in continuous variable format for "Repubican", "Democrat", and "Neutral" for each state, where higher value is assciated 
with higher level participation rate. To simplify the data for regression modeling, I decided to transform the continuous data to categorical data format: meaning
each state will be assigned to either of the 3 categories - "Republican", "Democrat", or "Neutral". 
  For example: 
    Alabama - Republican(87), Neutral(50), Democrat(29) 
    California - Republican (19), Neutral(20), Democrat(40)
  Then Alabama will be assigned to "Republican" category; California will be assigned to "Democrat" category
  
The benefit of turning continuous data into categorical data is we can
