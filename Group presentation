What they're expecting:
  very short guide to what we're doing within our group on:
    what question we're going to answer 
    how we're going to answer it 
    who's going to do what in the group 
    
    approx. 7 min long and everyone in group should speak 
    
   upload into Microsoft Stream
   Use Microsoft teams to get everybody into a call, present our groupwork there, record that session 
   and upload to microsoft stream 
   
   Expected slides: (one person has them up on their screen)
    - title, group number, link to github repo => when you call everybody in, each person: and record! 
           - ... More - record call - Share screen 
           - If audio cuts out - can fill in later (perhaps using subtitles?)
    - Question we're trying to answer: - what is it about? - why is it important? - what does the current 
     research say? 
    - How will we solve it? - what are you going to do? - what are you going to create? - what does your 
    website look like? (maybe have a mockup of the pages?) 
    - Who will do what? - who's in the team? - what role does each person have? - who is reponsible for what? 
    
    That's all! 
    => Stop recording: ... More 'stop recording' 
    
    - To save the recording: you see on the right that the recording is getting encoding. 
    - recording is in activity / chat of Microsoft teams and once downloaded will provide you
    with a link to Microsoft Teams 
    
    - After clicking link, under video select ... Add video to group channnel => share with channels => 
    Basc search: => basc quantitative methdods 2 => my groups => BASC =>  groups student presentations 2020: save
