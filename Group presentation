What they're expecting:
  very short guide to what we're doing within our group on:
    what question we're going to answer 
    how we're going to answer it 
    who's going to do what in the group 
    
    approx. 7 min long and everyone in group should speak 
    
   upload into Microsoft Stream
   Use Microsoft teams to get everybody into a call, present our groupwork there, record that session 
   and upload to microsoft stream 
   
   Expected slides: (one person has them up on their screen)
    - title, group number, link to github repo => when you call everybody in, each person: and record! 
           - ... More - record call - Share screen 
           - If audio cuts out - can fill in later (perhaps using subtitles?)
    - Question we're trying to answer: - what is it about? - why is it important? - what does the current 
     research say? 
    - How will we solve it? - what are you going to do? - what are you going to create? - what does your 
    website look like? (maybe have a mockup of the pages?) 
    - Who will do what? - who's in the team? - what role does each person have? - who is reponsible for what? 
    
    That's all! 
    => Stop recording: ... More 'stop recording' 
    
    - To save the recording: you see on the right that the recording is getting encoding. 
    - recording is in activity / chat of Microsoft teams and once downloaded will provide you
    with a link to Microsoft Teams 
    
    - After clicking link, under video select ... Add video to group channnel => share with channels => 
    Basc search: => basc quantitative methdods 2 => my groups => BASC =>  groups student presentations 2020: save
    
   - change name to group 16 presentation

From feedback 
-Finding a dataset about legislation and use it when draging conclusions from data analysis = maybe to explain outliers? lookiing at extremes --> have a more accurate unerstanding of reality 
-Legislation doesnt always match public opinion !! 
-Keeping correlation and regression 
-P value test 

-------------------------------------
Questions: 
-Look at research proposal introduction 
-Add some literature about factors affecting abortion 
-For each factors, each one of us should start looking at his/her data and think how he/she will analyze it, and what he/she will create from it + some justifications about our choices  
-For each factor, we will be doing a regression and correlation 
-Start cleaning data and do summary stats (saturday)
-Give some roles (fictional)


------------------------------------

Henry: decided on completion of high school which he thought was more useful 
ines: 

Scatter plots aren't conclusive 

------------------------------------

Presentation plan: 

- aim and objective (cf research proposal) 
- each person : 2/3 slides about their own data,
- Heat maps
- Confronting our abortions and the different factors: regression and how regression is not relevant --> multiple regression?? 
- Website
